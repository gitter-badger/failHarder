		<p _text="body">The name "Fail Harder" came from the awesome push-pin mural at <a href="http://www.wk.com/office/portland" target="blank">Wieden + Kennedy Portland</a>, which is featured in the documentary <a href="http://www.artandcopyfilm.org/" target="blank">Art &amp; Copy</a>.</p>

		<p _text="body">That mural represents dreaming big and daring to adventure into the realm of the unknown. Many adults struggle with this. Why? We've stigmatized failure, when in fact, it is simply defined as "the lack of success" (<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#es_th=1&q=define%20failure" target="blank">Google</a>). So, prior to actually acheiving success, we're all technically failures. And that's not a bad thing!</p>

		<p _text="body">Fail Harder is about remembering that failing is essentail to success. All humans fail, and that's alright. It's important to be able to say, "I haven't gotten to where I want to be yet, but I'll get there." Head over to the <a href="speak.html">Community</a> page for encouragement along the way and to offer encouragement to others who are on their own journeys. </p>

		<p _text="body">All that said, I hope this site helps encourage you through and to your greatest failures.</p>
