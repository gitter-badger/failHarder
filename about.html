		<p>And we're proud of it.</p>
		<p>Fail Harder was born as a result of an incredible TEDx talk by Carol Dweck entitled <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve" target="blank">The power of believing that you can improve</a>. She discusses the difference it makes to simply shift your mindset from believing you've failed to believing you just didn't get it yet.</p>

		<p>I didn't stop calling failures "failures" because I don't believe failure is a bad thing. I'm not saying failure feels good or that it doesn't suck. But, failure <em>is</em> awesome because it does equate to "not yet". I've seen this in my own life as I've failed my way into sucessful designs, relationships, versions of myself... Failure has been my best teacher, and had I avoided the things I didn't get right the first time, I never would have grown. That thought is scarier than any failure I could ever face.</p>

		<p>All that said, I hope this site helps encourage you through and to your greatest failures.</p>
