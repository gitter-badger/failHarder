Notes: 

start with personal experience avoiding failure
	being told I was "smart" & believing that corresponded to my ability to get something right immediately
	being afraid of being seen as "dumb"

why?

we know that learning is a process- when we're young and learning something new, we're often told things like, "no one get it right the first time" or "practice makes perfect (or better)"
